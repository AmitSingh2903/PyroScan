## 🚀 About the Project

**PyroScan** is a full-stack, browser-based machine learning platform for detecting **Pyrocumulonimbus (PyroCb)** cloud formations and predicting **wildfire risks** using real-time environmental data.

Unlike traditional tools that rely on cloud servers, PyroScan runs entirely in-browser using **TensorFlow.js + WebGL**, enabling **GPU-accelerated inference** on the edge with zero backend compute load. The system integrates satellite-style image classification, environmental risk modeling, and interactive geospatial analytics — all in a fast, mobile-friendly interface.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🌩️ **Cloud Detection**: Classifies uploaded cloud images (PyroCb or Normal) using a custom CNN.
- 🔥 **Wildfire Risk Prediction**: Ensemble model (NN + XGBoost + RF) based on 5 key environmental features.
- 🌐 **Real-Time Inference**: All ML models run directly in the browser via TensorFlow.js.
- 🧭 **Interactive Dashboard**: View predictions, heatmaps, and severity stats on an intuitive UI.
- 🛰️ **Geospatial Mapping**: Map recent detections using Leaflet.js.
- 📊 **Confidence & Risk Scoring**: Detailed prediction metadata with model confidence and severity.
- 🧾 **Supabase-Integrated**: Logs predictions, locations, and historical trends to a scalable PostgreSQL backend.
